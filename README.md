## Marking up a sandwich menu
Using the HTML document in exercise 2 - the_newcastle_sandwich_shop.html and the image - the_newcastle_sandwich_shop.png for reference add section elements such as `<nav`, `<main` etc where appropriate.

## Navigating between pages
1. Once the previous exercise has been completed, create links for 5 of the sandwiches (your choice which ones) in the menu section that link to a page with further details (you don't need to actually add further details to these pages).
2. Create blank HTML documents that these sandwiches should link to
Add a title and Heading level 1 to each of these new pages that reflect the title of the sandwich.
